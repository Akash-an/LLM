Just like a recipe book has instructions for making yummy food, DNA has instructions for making living things, like plants, animals, and even you!\\n\\nDNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid – that's a big, fancy name! Think of it as a special code that tells our bodies how to grow, what color our eyes will be, or even what kind of hair we have. It's packed with lots of information, like a blueprint.\\n\\nImagine all the people in the world holding hands and making a human chain, that's how long a single strand of DNA can be! But don't worry, it's all coiled up inside our cells. These cells are like tiny building blocks that make us who we are.\\n\\nDNA is made up of four special letters, called bases, which are named A, T, C, and G. Sort of like how we have different letters in the alphabet. These letters are written in a specific order, like a secret code. The order of these letters is what makes each of us unique and different from everyone else.\\n\\nScientists use DNA to solve mysteries, just like detectives solve crimes. They can look at a small piece of DNA and figure out if it matches someone they are looking for. It's pretty amazing!\\n\\nSo, remember, DNA is like a magical recipe book that tells our bodies how to be amazing and helps scientists solve mysteries.

It is portrayed as dangerous because it masquerades as excellence and can prevent individuals from even starting or finishing tasks. Perfectionism can magnify mistakes and minimize progress. Other characteristics of perfectionism include a tendency to feel miserable when not being productive and a belief that one must do everything on their own.

              "[Document(page_content='March, 2023\\n\\n5 Minutes Summary:\\n\\t• “Perfection is your enemy.” It appears in many forms.\\n\\t• The harder you try to be perfect, the less likely you’ll accomplish your goals.\\n\\t• Goals grow in size overtime, so to be reasonable, cut your goals in half.\\n\\t• Strategic incompetence is admitting that you don’t have time to do everything and something will deliberately go by the wayside during this season of your life.\\n\\t• Fun not only counts, but it’s necessary if you want get to the finish. Joyless goals fail.\\n\\t• You\\'ll find yourself avoiding your task by creating pre-requisites(noble obstacles), so question every pre-requisite.\\n\\t• Beware of distractions, specially the ones that masquerade as productive ones.\\n\\t• Overtime, you might have developed certain notions subconsciously which might affect your progress. For example, \"You have to go at in alone, help is for the weak\". Break these notions. Self-awareness and honesty with oneself only can help you here.\\n\\t• Record a few metrics to track your progress. Progress is usually slow and tracking it serves as motivation. Also, we usually misremember how our progress was the previous time, so keeping a log helps us stay in touch with reality.\\n\\t• The growth is logarithmic, don’t get disheartened by it.\\n\\t• We might come across some jitters in the final moments, be aware or seek help.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nStarting is fun, but the future belongs to finishers.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome Important Action items:\\n\\t1. Think back to other goals you’ve attempted. Were they too big? Write down what happened.\\n\\t2. Make a list of three things you could bomb during your goal.\\n\\t3. On a scale of 1 to 10, how fun is the goal you might be working on?\\n\\t4. Identify hiding places, noble obstacles or secret rules, if any.\\n\\t5. Write down one to three things you can track concerning your goal.\\n\\t6. Review a goal from the past to see if you can learn anything.\\n\\t\\n\\nChapter 1: The Day After Perfect\\n“Perfection is your enemy.”\\n\\nThis is the first lie that perfectionism tells you about goals: Quit if it isn’t perfect.\\nWe look for perfection in our progress, Once the streak is broken, we quit altogether. I couldn’t do it yesterday, “might as well skip today” is a common excuse we give ourselves.\\n“We want straight A’s, especially if it’s a goal we’ve thought about for any amount of time. We will gladly give up the whole thing when we discover some error or imperfection in our performance. More than that, we will even pre-quit, before we’ve even begun.”\\nThis sort of perfectionism is especially dangerous because it masquerades as excellence. We must realise that other end of this perfection is not failure but ‘Finished’. Finishing is more important than the size of finish, because finishing in itself is a great feeling and not finishing leaves a bad taste that haunts you.\\n“The problem is that perfectionism magnifies your mistakes and minimizes your progress. It does not believe in incremental success. Perfectionism portrays your goal as a house of cards. If one thing doesn’t go perfectly, the whole thing falls apart.”\\nThe harder you try to be perfect, the less likely you’ll accomplish your goals.\\nThe day after perfect is what separates finishers from starters.\\n\\nChapter 2: Cut Your Goal in Half\\nThe second lie of perfectionism: Your goal should be bigger.\\n\\nThe size of our goals grow real fast. We either want to achieve a 100% or its not worth even trying. This coupled with our snowballing goals, we end up not doing anything. We start with I can do something, then start dreaming of bigger things and soon end up feeling inadequate and just give up on the whole affair. We don’t want small growth. We want massive, overnight success. (from chapter 1)\\nBigger the goal, the bigger the initial rush we get from imagining it.\\nScientists call this “planning fallacy,” a concept first studied by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. They described this problem as “a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an optimism bias and underestimate the time needed.”\\nWhen we finally decide to start working on our gigantic goals, we start hearing “Far better to give up now than waste all that time and fail.”\\n\\nSo what do we need to do:\\nCut your goals in half\\nRemember the options are - Quit the goal because it was too big, or Cut it in half and finish it.\\nThe feeling of achievement, even minor ones, keep us going.\\n\\nActions:\\n\\t1. Think back to other goals you’ve attempted. Were they too big? Write down what happened.\\n\\t2. Write down a number associated with your goal. (It’s difficult to cut a feeling in half.) Decide whether you can cut your goal in half or double the timeline.\\n\\t3. Share your goal with someone you trust and ask him if it’s too extreme.\\n\\t4. If you’re uncomfortable with cutting your goal in half, spend a few minutes answering the question “What’s the worst that could happen?”\\n\\nChapter 4: Make It Fun if You Want It Done\\nThe fourth lie perfection tells you is: Fun doesn’t count.\\n\\nHave fun. Make sure your goal is fun. Make sure you enjoy it. Make sure there’s laughing and smiling involved with that thing you’re going to do.\\nPerfectionism thinks fun is a waste of time and holds no value.\\n“It is incorrect to believe that top athletes suffer great sacrifices to achieve their goals. Often, they don’t see what they do as sacrificial at all. They like it.”\\nFun not only counts, but it’s necessary if you want get to the finish. Joyless goals fail.\\n\\nTwo important factors in goal setting:\\n\\t1. satisfaction\\n\\t2. performance success.\\nOne speaks to how you felt about the process and the second focuses on what you actually got done.\\n\\nTwo ways of motivation:\\n\\t1. Reward: The reward that is generated by accomplishing the goal moves you.\\n\\t2. Fear: The fear of the future forces you to change the present.\\n\\nAs you choose between fear and a reward, please know that perfectionism will tell you that you don’t need either. Real winners don’t need motivation. They just do their job. They don’t need rewards or punishments, no carrots or sticks. They just put their nose to the grindstone. A reward is cheating. You’re better than that. The hard work is its own reward.\\n\\nActions:\\n\\t1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how fun is the goal you might be working on?\\n\\t2. Decide whether you’re motivated by fear or by reward.\\n\\t3. Pick three small points of fun you can add to your goal.\\n\\nChapter 5: Leave Your Hiding Places and Ignore Noble Obstacles\\n\\nA hiding place is an activity you focus on instead of your goal. \\nA noble obstacle is a virtuous-sounding reason for not working toward a finish.\\n\\nHiding Places\\nTwo types:\\n\\ta. Obvious Time Wasters: You’re afraid to face the fear of imperfection that comes along with every endeavour, so you’re hiding from it by doing something that requires no skill.\\n\\tb. Ones that masquerades as productive ones: They make you feel like you’re doing well when in reality you’re not getting anywhere on your most important projects.\\n\\t\\nHere are a few simple ways to identify them:\\n\\t1. If you blink and find yourself working on something besides your real goal, you’ve probably retreated to the first kind of hiding place: the obvious time waster.\\n\\t2. If you ever have to do a complicated, multistep explanation to say why what you’re doing is valuable, it probably isn’t. You’re probably actually camping out in the kind of hiding place that masquerades as productivity.\\n\\t3. If you really want to find a hiding place, ask a friend. It’s easy to deceive yourself by thinking a task is useful.\\n\\nNew Goals as Hiding Places:\\n\\tNew goals are enticing. They seem exciting and fancy. Don’t abandon your current goal for the new one, but don’t ignore them either, just put them at the finish line of the current goal.\\n\\t\\nNoble Obstacles\\nAt the heart of it, a noble obstacle is an attempt to make your goal harder than it has to be so you don’t have to finish, but can still look respectable.\\nIn the first kind of noble obstacle, perfectionism sneakily tells you that you cannot move toward your goal until you do something else: “I can’t do X until Y.”\\n“Until” is a hurdle you throw up on your track until the lane is so clogged you couldn’t possibly get started today. Look at all those obstacles. Today’s not the best day to go.\\n\\nActions:\\n\\t1. Ask the three questions to identify your hiding places.\\n\\t2. Start creating a list of “next goals” so that you have a home for any new ideas that come up.\\n\\t3. Try to simplify your goal in one way\\n\\t4. Admit and eliminate any side goals that you’ve taken on.\\n\\nChapter 3: Choose What to Bomb\\nPerfectionism’s third lie is: “You can do it all.” — I’m here to tell you that you can’t.\\n\\nWhen you can’t do it all, you feel ashamed and give up.\\nAnd what we never like to admit is that you don’t just give time to something, you take it from something else. To be good at one thing you have to be bad at something else.\\nWe want to be everyone’s best friend, to have every person in the world think we are wonderful, and we think that means spending as much time with every friend as he or she would like.\\nWhen you choose in advance what you want to drop, you remove the sting of shame.\\nStrategic incompetence is admitting that you don’t have time to do everything and something will deliberately go by the wayside during this season of your life.\\nThe two options we have now are:\\n\\t1. Attempt more than is humanly possible and fail.\\n\\t2. Choose what to bomb and succeed at a goal that matters.\\n\\t\\nActions:\\n\\t1. Make a list of three things you could bomb during your goal.\\n\\t2. For time drains you can’t bomb, figure out a way you could simplify them.\\n\\nChapter 6: Get Rid of Your Secret Rules\\nYou’ve got some secret rules that make it really difficult for you to finish.\\n\\nFor example, \\n\\ta rule was “For something to count, it has to be difficult.” A lot of high performers carry that sort of secret rule along with them. If an exercise is enjoyable and you have fun doing it, it must not count. Joy then becomes a good indicator that you’re not working hard enough or making enough progress. Pull that thread far enough and you end up with the rule “If I’m not miserable, I’m not doing something productive.”\\nanother example\\n\\t “Some pilots go fast to show you they know what they’re doing. They’re afraid to work hard because then it won’t seem authentic or natural.”\\nand another example:\\n\\tOne of perfectionism’s chief goals is to isolate you. Perfectionism will tell you a very popular secret rule: “You have to do it all on your own.”\\n\\tDon’t ever accept the secret rule that you have to go it alone. Don’t let perfectionism isolate you. Find someone with an amazing diploma and then borrow it.\\n\\n\\nFour Questions to Smoke Out Your Secret Rules:\\n\\t1. Do I even like ____________? One of perfectionism’s favourite secret rules is “Only miserable, difficult goals count.”\\nDon’t wait to be honest with yourself if you realize you no longer like what you’re working on. Don’t let perfectionism keep you stuck.\\n\\t\\n\\t2. What’s my real goal?\\nWhat’s fun about this approach is that knowing what your real goal is opens you up to a wide variety of methods to accomplish it.\\n\\t\\n\\t3. Does the method I’m using match who I am? A very common secret rule is “What I’m naturally talented at doesn’t count.” If something comes easily or comfortably, it must not be good. Why does perfectionism offer up this rule? Because if things that come naturally are cheating, then you’re doomed to pursue difficult goals you’re sure to quit.\\nIf you don’t have a lot of joy in your goal right now, make sure you’re using a method that plays to your strengths. If you pursue the right goal in the wrong way, you still end up in the wrong place.\\n\\t\\n\\t4. Is it time to quit?\\nThe middle of any goal is difficult and uncomfortable. But, finishing a goal you absolutely hate isn’t a win. The art is in deciding which is it(the book doesn’t mention any solutions).\\n\\nActions:\\n\\t1. Listen for a few secret rules and write them down.\\n\\t2. Write the truth next to each secret rule. To find it, ask “What does that mean” and “Who says?”\\n\\nChapter 8: The Day Before Done\\nThe final jitters, ones just before the finish line.\\n\\nThe Three Final Subconscious Fears:\\n\\t1. The fear that it won’t be perfect\\n\\t2. The fear of “what next?” \\n\\nAnd these fears might prevent us from ever completing the goal. In such cases, \\n\\nReach out to another person,\\n\"We don’t ever age out of needing someone to believe in us.\"\\n\\nor ask yourself:\\n“What am I getting out of not finishing?”\\n\\nWhat are some common benefits people receive from not finishing? Here are three different things that three people who have a hard time finishing told:\\n\\t1. Control over the outcome. Because if I try, I might fail. If I never try, I at least know the outcome.\\n\\t2. Praise for being a martyr. If you are “sacrificing” your goals by focusing on other aspects\\nof life (children, spouse’s goals, other life events, for example), you receive accolades from others who are impressed by that “selfless” act.\\n\\t3. Lowered expectations from other people. If I try to succeed, then the expectations of perfection will be\\neven higher next time. I’d rather occasionally surprise people with what I can do rather than build up a reputation of success.\\n\\nStarting is fun, but the future belongs to finishers.\\n\\nChapter 7: Use Data to Celebrate Your Imperfect Progress\\nRecord a few(not many) metrics to track your progress.\\n\\nReason:\\n\\tWe easily get demotivated when progress isn’t visible. Progress is quiet. It whispers. On the other hand, failures scream.\\n\\tWe hope that with each passing accomplishment, the progress will grow and momentum will build, but that’s rarely how things go. Progress follows law of diminishing returns, with every successive accomplishment, the effect of success plateaus. Successive goals become harder and would take more time/effort.\\n\\tA little data can make a big difference. It helps you see through claims that you’re not getting anywhere and helps you celebrate your achievements.\\nAnother Reason:\\n\\tWe often forget how hard it was the first time achieving something. We usually underestimate the effort need to achieve our goals based on similar past achievements if only rely on memory.\\n\\tOur memories are constantly editing themselves and therefore are unreliable. Feelings are not much better.\\n\\tWith data, We might set more reasonable goals and avoid desperate attempt to live up to impossible standards.\\n\\t\\nKnow Where You Came from to Get Where You’re Going\\nTrying to finish any goal is like running uphill. At the top is the finish line and in the middle it feels so far away. If you stare up the hill, it’s easy to get discouraged. But look at zero. Look at the starting line, look at the bottom of the hill.\\n\\nReview your past goals:\\n\\t1. What happened last time you attempted a goal like the one you’re planning or with a similar goal?\\n\\t\\ta. How long did it take?\\n\\t\\tb. If you didn’t finish, which part tripped you up?\\n\\t\\tc. If you could do it differently this time, what would you change?\\n\\t2. What helped you achieve your goal?\\n\\t\\ta. What were you doing?\\n\\t\\tb. What elements of that moment helped the most?\\n\\t\\tc. Where were you?\\n\\t\\td. What did you do before?\\n\\t\\te. What did you do after?\\n\\nActions:\\n\\t1. Write down one to three things you can track concerning your goal.\\n\\t2. Review a goal from the past to see if you can learn anything.\\n\\t3. Find your airplane. What’s the way you work best?\\n\\t4. If you’re already in the middle of a goal, decide if you need to adjust\\nyour goal, timeline, or actions.\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'finish'})]"
